# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-08-03

This is the human-facing dashboard for current repo state. Keep it short,
latest-first, and pointer-based. Do not use this file as a changelog or
execution ledger. When older shipped detail is no longer needed for today's
orientation, move it to plans, ADRs, retrospectives, or `docs/human/**` and
leave a link.

## Current Focus

The latest hybrid eval candidate at `output/eval-harness/20260803T023049Z/`
mechanically reports all 25 selected rows passed with no provider failures,
blocked rows, infrastructure retries, or regressions. CloudML executed and
collected 20 isolated rows while 5 external-provider rows ran locally, reaching
8-way peak concurrency and 2.282x observed execution speedup.

The candidate has an integrity blocker: all three underlying product runs for
`openai-agents-sdk-cleanup-live-eval` ended with `live_status.phase="failed"`
because the product checker received the eval-only
`--require-advisory-scoring` flag. The artifact grader nevertheless marked the
row passed. Product-checker replay after fixing the ownership mismatch accepts
one run and rejects two for real agent-behavior failures, so the reported 3/3
pass result is invalid. See
`output/eval-harness/20260803T023049Z/cloudml-ops/integrity-review.md`.
This run is retained as evidence but is not an accepted durable baseline;
publication remains unauthorized.

The checker/eval boundary now fails closed: product checker nonzero exits are
eval failures, advisory scoring remains eval-owned, smoke checker policy uses
the smoke preset, and no artifact recovery bypasses a failed product command.

The agent Skill delivery implementation is deterministic-complete, including
terminal completion snapshots and five frozen delivery cells. Its fresh
CloudML `static-full` stop gate is not accepted: the internal Responses route
probe passed, one live attempt was preempted, and the allowed retry exited 2
without an accepted 3/3 row result. Attempt-isolated packaging also omitted the
row result because the scoped manifest retained the original shard output path.
See `docs/status/active/agent-skill-delivery-eval.md`.

The active product shape is:

- `surface=household-world` for no-preset open household goals.
- `surface=household-world preset=map-build` for Runtime Metric Map evidence.
- `surface=household-world preset=cleanup` for cleanup.
- `surface=planner-proof` for the confidence route.

Current household map/runtime contracts:

- Base Metric Map is the required start-of-run map context.
- Runtime Metric Map owns map-build and observation semantic evidence.
- Runtime Map Prior Snapshot is the downstream prior wrapper.
- Canonical Runtime Map Priors are explicitly promoted, content-addressed, and
  reused read-only across normal provider consumer matrices.
- Product runtime, smoke helpers, and current tests fail loudly when a required
  Base Metric Map bundle is missing.

Eval suites are first-class architecture evidence. Deterministic suites are
available through:

```bash
just agent::eval suite=smoke_regression budget=smoke
just agent::eval suite=open_ended_goals budget=smoke
just agent::eval suite=map_build_quality budget=smoke
just agent::eval suite=map_consumer_no_prior budget=smoke
```

Live eval execution is opt-in with `live_execution=run`; default non-direct eval
requests record blocked identity/preflight packets instead of launching real
providers.

## Next Action

Repair attempt-aware CloudML scoped-manifest output paths, freeze a new run,
and rerun only the three-trial `static-full` stop gate. Do not run the remaining
delivery matrix or publish durable baseline/catalog artifacts until that gate
passes and the candidate receives human confirmation.

## Current Blockers

- Eval baseline publication is blocked until a new full candidate replaces the
  invalid `20260803T023049Z` evidence.
- Agent Skill delivery comparison is blocked at Phase 1 because the fresh
  `static-full` CloudML proof did not produce accepted 3/3 terminal evidence.
- Agibot and B1 injected dependency readiness passes with the existing local SDK, Map 12 bundle,
  B1 scene, and alignment/navigation proofs. Real-robot movement remains unauthorized and requires
  a present operator plus the existing localization, run-enablement, and E-stop gates.

- Agent operating details: `docs/agents/operating-runbook.md`
- GSD execution state: `.planning/STATE.md`
- Current GSD phase details: follow the latest phase link in `.planning/STATE.md`

## Repo-Wide Parked Work

- Queued implementation tasks unrelated to the current active focus:
  `TODOS.md`
- Scratch ideas and future directions unrelated to the current active focus:
  `THOUGHTS.md`
- GitHub issues track externally visible work for `MiaoDX/roboclaws`.

The cleanup plan is mechanically archiving only explicitly terminal active
capsules; active, blocked, ambiguous, and JSON evidence surfaces remain in
place.

## Workflow Contract

Use the staged workflow:

`idea -> docs/plans/<slug>.md -> review/autoplan -> GSD plan/execute -> verify -> retrospective`

Rules:

- `STATUS.md` answers "what is happening now?"
- `docs/plans/` owns pre-GSD plans.
- `.planning/` is GSD-owned execution detail.
- `docs/human/` is the human-readable doc set.
- `docs/adr/` records durable decisions, not progress.
- Root `PLAN.md` is a legacy pointer, not an active plan.
- `TODOS.md` and `THOUGHTS.md` are parked-work surfaces, not current status.
- Parallel terminals should use one task-owned file under
  `docs/status/active/`.
- At GSD closeout/verify/ship, update this file only if repo-level current
  focus, latest phase, next action, or blocker changed.
