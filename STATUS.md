# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-07-26

This is the human-facing dashboard for current repo state. Keep it short,
latest-first, and pointer-based. Do not use this file as a changelog or
execution ledger. When older shipped detail is no longer needed for today's
orientation, move it to plans, ADRs, retrospectives, or `docs/human/**` and
leave a link.

## Current Focus

Public-core minimization is the current repository focus. The active capsule is
`docs/status/active/public-core-internal-integration-minimization.md`.

The public runtime now has exactly three explicit OpenAI Agents SDK provider profiles:
`custom-responses`, `minimax-responses`, and `kimi-openai-chat`. Private remote-operation ownership,
retired provider routes, bare coding-agent helpers, and unsupported RAW-FPV live transport have
been removed from the public core. Agibot and B1 remain validation-only worlds with injected
dependencies and are omitted from default discovery. SDK provider launches are gated by provider
readiness rather than work-network classification; the network guard remains on the OpenClaw and
system-provider routes that require it.

The active product shape is:

- `surface=household-world` for no-preset open household goals.
- `surface=household-world preset=map-build` for Runtime Metric Map evidence.
- `surface=household-world preset=cleanup` for cleanup.
- `surface=planner-proof` for the confidence route.

Current household map/runtime contracts:

- Base Metric Map is the required start-of-run map context.
- Runtime Metric Map owns map-build and observation semantic evidence.
- Runtime Map Prior Snapshot is the downstream prior wrapper.
- Canonical Runtime Map Priors are explicitly promoted, content-addressed, and
  reused read-only across normal provider consumer matrices.
- Product runtime, smoke helpers, and current tests fail loudly when a required
  Base Metric Map bundle is missing.

Eval suites are first-class architecture evidence. Deterministic suites are
available through:

```bash
just agent::eval suite=smoke_regression budget=smoke
just agent::eval suite=open_ended_goals budget=smoke
just agent::eval suite=map_build_quality budget=smoke
just agent::eval suite=map_consumer_no_prior budget=smoke
```

Live eval execution is opt-in with `live_execution=run`; default non-direct eval
requests record blocked identity/preflight packets instead of launching real
providers.

## Next Action

Review the refreshed sanitized one-commit candidate and the remaining human gates before
authorizing any publication. No public push is authorized by the completed refactor proof.

## Current Blockers

- No agent-fixable refactor verification blocker remains. The focused eval harness passes all four
  required rows, including the Kimi operator-session live row, and both Kimi and Custom Responses
  product routes reach terminal MCP reports. Custom provider values were injected process-locally;
  no retired environment alias was added to source or committed configuration.
- Agibot and B1 injected dependency readiness passes with the existing local SDK, Map 12 bundle,
  B1 scene, and alignment/navigation proofs. Real-robot movement remains unauthorized and requires
  a present operator plus the existing localization, run-enablement, and E-stop gates.
- Isaac strict preflight now passes disk, GPU, Torch, Isaac Lab, and runtime checks with 602.55 GiB
  free. Importing Isaac Sim remains blocked on explicit Omniverse EULA acceptance; the refactor did
  not accept it on the operator's behalf.
- The exact candidate's dependency-license inventory has one unresolved metadata caveat:
  MolmoSpaces runtime-extra dependency `beaker-py` 2.x declares no license in its published
  artifacts, and its referenced source repository is unavailable for verification.
- Publication remains unauthorized until the reviewed candidate evidence is presented for human
  approval.

## AI-Agent Sources

- Agent operating details: `docs/agents/operating-runbook.md`
- GSD execution state: `.planning/STATE.md`
- Current GSD phase details: follow the latest phase link in `.planning/STATE.md`
- Pre-GSD plans: `docs/plans/`
- Durable decisions: `docs/adr/`
- Shipped history: `docs/retrospectives/`
- Concurrent standalone work: `docs/status/active/`

## Repo-Wide Parked Work

- Queued implementation tasks unrelated to the current active focus:
  `TODOS.md`
- Scratch ideas and future directions unrelated to the current active focus:
  `THOUGHTS.md`
- GitHub issues track externally visible work for `MiaoDX/roboclaws`.

Current MapBuild optimization work is not parked. Its active state lives in
`docs/status/active/map-build-quality-eval-harness.md`.

## Workflow Contract

Use the staged workflow:

`idea -> docs/plans/<slug>.md -> review/autoplan -> GSD plan/execute -> verify -> retrospective`

Rules:

- `STATUS.md` answers "what is happening now?"
- `docs/plans/` owns pre-GSD plans.
- `.planning/` is GSD-owned execution detail.
- `docs/human/` is the human-readable doc set.
- `docs/adr/` records durable decisions, not progress.
- Root `PLAN.md` is a legacy pointer, not an active plan.
- `TODOS.md` and `THOUGHTS.md` are parked-work surfaces, not current status.
- Parallel terminals should use one task-owned file under
  `docs/status/active/`.
- At GSD closeout/verify/ship, update this file only if repo-level current
  focus, latest phase, next action, or blocker changed.
